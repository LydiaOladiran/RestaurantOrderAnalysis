# RestaurantOrderAnalysis
I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis on a restaurant Order Dataset using SQL. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle in .xlsx file format, it was then coverted into a .csv file and imported into Microsoft SQL Server Managemet Studio.
This dataset has details of orders placed by customers to the restaurants in a food delivery app. There are 500 orders that were placed on a day. 

## In this analysis i answered the following questions

1) What is the total number of items sold?
2) What is the total amount of orders?
4) Which customer ordered the most?
5) What is the number of customer per zone?
6) When do customers order more in a day?
7)  Which restaurant received the most orders?
8) What is the most used mode of payment?
9) Which is the most liked cuisine?
10) Which zone has the most sales?
11) What is the total order for each zone?
